# My Project

Welcome to my personal project portfolio! This repository contains some of the projects I've worked on to explore and apply what I've learned.

## About Me

Hi, I'm Libei. I'm currently studying mathematics and I'm interested in combining theory with practical applications. I use this space to document and share some of the things I've built or explored.

## Projects

Here are some of the projects included in this repository:

A production-style ETL pipeline that ingests and transforms [Olist’s Brazilian e-commerce dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce) using **Azure Data Factory**, **Databricks (PySpark)**, and the **Medallion Architecture**. Cleaned and enriched data is stored in ADLS Gen2 and queried via Synapse — supporting future BI dashboards and customer segmentation.
